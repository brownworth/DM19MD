(TCT)
Looks for the string "TCT" but then allows it to be captured.

(TCT)\1
Looks for the string "TCT", captures it (as capture group 1) and then finds a repeat. This will find "TCTTCT".

(T[AC]T)
Looks for the string "TAT" or "TCT" and captures it (as capture group 1), but not "TACT".

(T[AC]T)\1
Looks for the string "TAT" or "TCT", captures it (as capture group 1) and then finds a repeat. This will find "TATTAT" or TCTTCT", but not "TCTTAT" or "TATTCT".

(T[AC]T)((\w{3}){1,3})(CGT)
Finds "TAT" or "TCT" (capture group 1), followed by 1 to 3 sets (capture group 2) of three characters (capture group 3), and then "CGT" (capture group 4).

Using the last one as an example, can use this as the replacement string to separate the characters out inside of the text:
---\1|\2|\4---
turning TCTTCAATACGT into ---TCT|TCAATA|CGT---

searching for .*?(T[AC]T)((\w{3}){1,3})(CGT)
and replacing with \1\2\4\n (\n means new line)
will make a list of our matches (with the exception of some extraneous stuff at the end.). The .*? part at the beginning of the search segment essentially means: "look for the smallest set of characters between two sets of matches."
